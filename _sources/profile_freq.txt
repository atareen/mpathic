Overview
-------------
``profile_freq`` is a program within the sortseq package which calculates the
frequency of each base (or amino acid) at each position in the library.

After you install `MPAthic`_, this program will be available to run at the command line. 

Command-line usage
---------------------
.. argparse::
   :module: MPAthic.sortseq_for_doc
   :func: parser
   :prog: MPAthic
   :path: profile_freq
   
Examples
-----------

The input format for this module must be in the standard form. 
The input table must contain a column labeled ct which is the sum
of counts for each of the sequencing bins (bin_0 through bin_K). The following 
columns should be labeled ct_0 ... ct_K, and should contain the sequencing counts
for each bin 0 through K. Bin 0 must be the unsorted or unselected bin. If you did
not sequence the unsorted bin, you should omit column ct_0 and start with ct_1.
The last column should contain sequence identity. If the sequences are DNA the
column should be labeled 'seq', if they are RNA, the column should be labeled
'seq_rna', and if they are amino acid sequences they should be labeled 'seq_pro'.
Order of columns does matter.

Example Input Table::

   ct    ct_0     ct_1     ct_2    seq
   13    1        5        7      ACG
   28    8        5        5      GGT
   ...

The output from this function will display a column with the position, a
column with mutation rate, and a column with error in calculated mutation rate.

Example Output Table::

   pos    ct_A     ct_C     ct_G     ct_T
   0      .25      .25      .4       .1    
   1      .2       .3      .25      .25
   ...

Example Command to Run the analysis::
   
    sortseq profile_freq -i data.txt -o freqs.txt
