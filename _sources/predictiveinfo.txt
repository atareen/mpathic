Overview
-------------
``predictiveinfo`` is a program within the MPAthic package which computes
the mutual information between a linear or nearest neighbor energy matrix 
model and a data set. Models which are closer to reality will have a 
higher mutual information value.

After you install `MPAthic`_, this program will be available to run at the command line. 

Command-line usage
---------------------
.. argparse::
   :module: MPAthic.sortseq_for_doc
   :func: parser
   :prog: MPAthic
   :path: predictiveinfo

   

   
Example Input and Output
-----------

The input table should be a sorted library data set (the model should be specified
after the -m flag). You should use the --start and --end flags to specify the
region in the data set that the model corresponds to. The --modeltype flag
should be used to specify whether is is a linear matrix (MAT) model or a nearest
neighbor (NBR) model. 

Example Linear Model File::

   pos    val_A    val_C    val_G     val_T
   0      .04      -.3      -.2       .15
   1      .2       .1       -.44      .05
   ...

By default the program will
compute the error via bootstrapping. To skip this step, use the --no_err option

The data input table to this program must contain a column labeled ct which is the sum
of counts for each of the sequencing bins (bin_0 through bin_K). The following 
columns should be labeled ct_0 ... ct_K, and should contain the sequencing counts
for each bin 0 through K. Bin 0 must be the unsorted or unselected bin. If you did
not sequence the unsorted bin, you should omit column ct_0 and start with ct_1.
The last column should contain sequence identity. If the sequences are DNA the
column should be labeled 'seq', if they are RNA, the column should be labeled
'seq_rna', and if they are amino acid sequences they should be labeled 'seq_pro'.
Order of columns does matter.

Example Input Table::

   ct    ct_0     ct_1     ct_2    seq
   13    1        5        7      ACG
   28    8        5        5      GGT
   ...


Example Output Table::

    info    info_err
    .94     .06

Example command to run the analysis::

   MPAthic predictiveinfo -i my_dataset.txt -m my_linear_matrix_model.txt --modeltype MAT --start 5 --end 20
